This The Second Assignment in Course Introduction to Embedded System
The aim of the assignment to make a makefile to control the build process of the .c and .h file
with Two different platform
***********************************************************************************************************************
The assignment was to use the GNU Tool make,Size and objdump
- I needed to generate a handful of files for each complete build. These are:
  . c1m2.map Map file
  . Dependency files
  . Individual Object files
  . c1m2.out Output Executable file
  . Report file of code size (using size GNU Tool)

- Suppot two Target Platforms
- Build Targets:
 . Generate the preprocessed output of all c-program implementation files
 . Generate assembly output of c-program implementation files and the final output executable
 . Generate the object file for all c-source files (but do not link) by specifying the object file you want to compile
 . compile all object files, but DO NOT link (compile-all)
 . compile all object files, but DO NOT link (build/all)
 . remove all compiled objects, preprocessed outputs, assembly outputs, executable files and build output files (CLEAN)
 .Generate the Dependeny output of all c-program implementation files
